### "Working with *GIT*"

[GitHub](http://github.com) is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:
  * Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see README files on GitHub)
  * Issue tracking (including feature requests) with labels, milestones, assignees and a search engine
  * Wikis
  * Pull requests with code review and comments
  * Commits history
  * Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members
  * Integrations Directory[14]
  * Unified and split diffs
  * Email notifications
  * Option to subscribe someone to notifications by mentioning them.
  * Emojis
  * GitHub Pages: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://username.github.io.[1]
  * Nested task-lists within files
  * Visualization of geospatial data
  * 3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas".
